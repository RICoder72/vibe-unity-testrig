This Unity project is a test rig for a package I am creating for Unity.
The package is located in Packages/com.ricoder.vibe-unity.
The package is designed to allow claude-code to generate Unity Scenes and Assets via JSON.
The package makes use of a file watching system in Unity.
There is a README.md that explains what the project is about in full detail.
